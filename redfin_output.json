        "summary": "High Rents and Low Hassle!  Photos show quality of rehab. Property better than competition for two reasons. First, massive scope of rehab means City inspections recently completed for New Heaters, New Plumbing, New Electrical, New framing, New Roof, New Stucco, and New Appliances, in addition to normal cosmetic upgrades you see elsewhere like new flooring and paint. This translates to peace of mind for decades to come. Second, sold without possession or leases!  This means ALL THREE units can get Fair Market Value right away. No inheriting old tenants paying $500/mo like some properties. Local property managers estimate $6,000 up to $7,000 per month in rent! Downstairs is 3 bed (modeled as 2+dining but previously used as 3rd bed) + bath. Two units up. One unit up has 2+1.  Second unit up has 1 bedroom and bath on main floor, + 1 bedroom in attic + 400SF additional living space in attic. Attic space may not be permitted. HPOZ. Must see to appreciate.
